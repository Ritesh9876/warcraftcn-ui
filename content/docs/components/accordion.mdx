    <AccordionContent>
      Prince Arthas Menethil returned home not as a savior, but as the harbinger
      of ruin. Under the influence of Frostmourne, he marched upon his own
      kingdom. The capital of Lordaeron fell in a single night, its banners
      burned and its people raised into undeath. Thus began the reign of the
      Scourge in the Eastern Kingdoms.

    <AccordionTrigger icon="sword">The Rise of the Lich King</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      High atop the Frozen Throne, the spirit of Ner’zhul awaited its chosen
      champion. Arthas ascended the icy spire and shattered the prison of the
      Lich King, donning the Helm of Domination. In that moment, the prince and
      the orc shaman became one being — the Lich King — ruler of the Scourge and
      master of death.

    <AccordionTrigger icon="shield">The Battle of Mount Hyjal</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      As Archimonde and the Burning Legion sought to claim the World Tree, an
      unlikely alliance formed. Humans, Orcs, and Night Elves stood united
      against annihilation. Upon the slopes of Mount Hyjal, sacrifice and
      strategy turned the tide, and the Legion’s invasion was shattered in
      arcane fire and ancient magic.
